# Git Practice

There are multiple exercises in this repository, consisting of a README file. Solve each one to the best of your ability inside a Python file in the corresponding directory.

Do this ON YOUR OWN BRANCH, so everyone's code can exist in the repo together.

Make sure to commit and push to your own branch as you go.
